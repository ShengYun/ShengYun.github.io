title: Choosing another vim colorscheme
---


The colorschemes I am considering is:

- `torte` one of vim's built in colorschemes.
- [`dbs`](https://github.com/ShengYun/vim-colorscheme-dbs) (a colorscheme I made myself, works well with C only... it is horrible with other languages, though I did use it for a long time since it works well with [`TagHighlight`](http://www.cgtk.co.uk/vim-scripts/taghighlight))
- [`solarized`](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) (a popular colorscheme, I used it's dark variant, but it's main project is not activated anymore and I believe that the colors are different on Windows(GVim) and Mac(MacVim))
- [`lucius`](https://github.com/jonathanfilip/vim-lucius) another great colorscheme, but I find it hard to tell the difference with normal text and strings.
- [`molokai`](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) A very popular colorscheme, lots of people love it and it is also `sublime text's` default colorscheme, but `molokai` still has some difference with the original `monokai` which comes from `TextMate` I believe.
- `desert` and `delek`. These are both vim's built in colorschemes, one dark theme and one light theme.

I'm currently trying `desert` and `delek`. One for my dark theme and one for my light theme. Seems good now, lets see if they can stay as my default theme for a few years.
