title: How did I learn VIM
---

<div class="message">
    This is the experience of how I learn VIM and finally get addicted to it, also I would like to share some plugins I use. Or maybe I can put it in another blog.

### The first time I meet VIM
The first time I heard about VIM is my linux course in university, I though linux was awesome and like to learn anything which seems to be cool. So that was the first time I tried to use VIM, and what I did was literally open VIM in terminal, and struggled to close it. Although it was not a delightful experience, I still have some fantasy to learn VIM.

So after several months, I tried to walk through VIM's tutorial, which is, kind of useful, but still can't help me do my job. I was spoiled by Visual Studio, I though VIM was just some hard to use ancient tool. The most important thing is, the guys I work with, they don't know how to use VIM either, everyone is happy with Visual Studio and using VIM is, Umm... zhuangbility behaviour:)

So I didn't try to learn VIM later, but one day I found a blog which shows VIM's power and teaches people how to learn VIM progressively, so I read the blog, and finally got some clue about VIM, [here](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/) is the link of that blog, if you can read Chinese, click [here](http://coolshell.cn/articles/5426.html) for a Chinese version.

I believe in China, VIM users are more than emacs users, because when I tried to learn emacs yesterday, I can't find much useful information about how to turn my emacs into an useable IDE, on the contrary, there are lots of information about how to turn my VIM into an IDE, the one I read was [this](http://blog.csdn.net/fbfsber008/article/details/7055842) article, really simple, and you can setup your VIM step by step. Although this article is somehow outdated now, it can still give you a felling about how VIM's plugins works, and maybe some simple concepts about how to config plugins. *(Please let me know if there is a similar emacs tutorial)*.

### Plugins I use
<div class="message">
    My work machine is Windows and my personal computer is Mac, I also would like to work on some linux(ubuntu) machines, so I'd like my plugins be as general as possible.

[Here's](https://github.com/ShengYun/dbsvim/tree/master/bundle) a list of my plugins.
