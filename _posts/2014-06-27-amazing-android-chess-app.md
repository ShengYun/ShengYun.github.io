title: Chess - An Amazing android chess application
---

I was using [tchess pro](http://www.tchessgame.com/pro.php) on my wife's iPad and iTouch, but the phone I'm using an Android phone, so I went finding a good Chess application on Android.

### Features I'd like to use in this application

1. Can load **pgn** files, not only for games, also **puzzles**.
2. Can play online, either live or correspondent chess. *(This really doesn't matter that much since [chess.com](http://www.chess.com/play/android) has an Android version available)*
3. Have or can load an openings database.
4. Can play chess with me, and also could let me setup positions in order to analyse a game.

### Applications I tried

Actually I think I'm happy with [tchess pro](http://www.tchessgame.com/pro.php) and [chess.com](http://www.chess.com/play/iphone), but as I said before, I'm currently using an Android phone and I can only use my wife's iPad/iTouch when she doesn't. So I tried [ShredderChess](http://www.shredderchess.com/chess-program/shredder-android.html), unfortunately, it doesn't support loading **pgn puzzles**, and it can't play online, but the most horrible thing is, I really think some of it's built in puzzles are wrong, I just can't understand the solution, and there is **no** explanation, the only thing I can do is to see how does the AI handle it, sometimes, it ends up as a draw, sometimes it even losses materials later. So scaling from 1 to 10, I can only give Shredder a **5**.

### The great Chess application on Android
With the bad experience on Shredder, I began to find a chess application on Android which could fit my needs, finally, I found [Chess](http://www.jwtc.nl/), it really exceeded my expectations.

Here's the feature list from it's official website:

- Play against your Android
- 2000 practice positions
- 500 puzzles
- Play online (FICS)
- Correspondence chess
- Set up a position on the board
- Use as a chess board
- Save and edit games
- Navigate through history
- Chess 960
- Uses opening database
- Import and export via e-mail or clipboard
- Touch-screen interface
- Support and version info via developer website

- No ads, just chess

There are some other awesome features which are not mentioned above, such as **switching UCI engines**, **create opening databases**, **create practice set aka puzzles**, **let your smart TV show the chess-board when on the same Local Area Network**. I believe there are more I didn't noticed, but the above features is enough for me:). Also, it is highly configurable, you can also **import** lots of things like games, puzzles, openings etc. from your SD-Card. Screen shots are [here](http://www.jwtc.nl/chess).

After playing with it for about 3 hours, I thinks several things could be improved.

1. Show previews for chess board color schemes and piece sets.
2. Option to show history moves vertically.
3. Option to show history moves and captured pieces simultaneously, maybe some other information too.
4. More support to openings, not just tell the user the current opening name, maybe give some hints about the opening moves.
5. A short tutorial of the FICS commands would be fantastic.


### Something more AWESOME
The project is an [**open source** project on GitHub](https://github.com/jcarolus/android-chess) and I can actually try to make improvements, before writing this post, I just cloned the code and made a simple pull request to enrich the project's `.gitignore` file. I'll try to read the code at my spare time and maybe make some changes:)

I really have faith in this project, AWESOME job and thank you **VERY MUCH** [Jeroen Carolus](https://github.com/jcarolus)
